      <h2>Elf</h2>
      <p>
        Elves possess a graceful, slender physique that is accentuated by their
        long, pointed ears. It is a mistake, however, to consider them weak or
        feeble, as the thin limbs of an elf can contain surprising power. The
        long-lived elves are children of the natural world. They seek to live in
        balance with the wild and understand it better than most other mortals.
        Elves also have an appreciation for the written word, magic, and
        painstaking research. Their naturally keen minds and senses, combined
        with their inborn patience, make them particularly suited to wizardry.
