        More than capable of upholding the honor of their deities in battle,
        clerics often prove stalwart and capable combatants. Their true strength
        lies in their capability to draw upon the power of their deities,
        whether to increase their own and their alliesâ€™ prowess in battle, to
        vex their foes with divine magic, or to lend healing to companions in
        need.
